**Author**: Brent Baker  
**Date**: July 2025  

This repository contains the full text of the SET publication — a resonance-based grand unified theory describing matter, space, time, and energy as stable projections of singularity–expanse interactions.

## Summary
At the heart of SET is Baker’s Law:

```
ν = mc² / h
```

This identity holds for all matter and energy forms across more than 70 orders of magnitude. SET reinterprets quantum mechanics, gravity, and cosmology using a single coherent framework of resonance-based standing waves.

The paper includes mathematical derivations, empirical reinterpretations, and testable predictions for real-world validation.

# SET Shared Memory Repository

This repository supports the development and exploration of the **Singularity–Expanse Theory (SET)** — a unifying physical framework introduced by Brent Baker in July 2025.

## 📄 Preprint Submitted (Pending Publication)

**Title:** *Baker’s Law and the Singularity–Expanse Framework: A Universal Resonance Between Mass and Frequency*  
**Author:** Brent Baker  
**Status:** Submitted to arXiv on July 5, 2025 — pending approval  
**ORCID:** [https://orcid.org/0009-0000-2115-3573](https://orcid.org/0009-0000-2115-3573)

This foundational paper introduces **Baker’s Law**:

\[
\nu = \frac{mc^2}{h}
\]

...and frames frequency as a fundamental resonance between opposing forces—**singularity (inward)** and **expanse (outward)**—projected into 4D space from a 5D energetic interaction.
